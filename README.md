Data and analysis from Hipps et al. (in preparation)

To execute analysis of tabular protein expression data (output from image analysis) open R, set working directory to "analysis" directory in this repository, make sure that you have all the required dependencies (mclust, umap, MASS and sp) and execute the code in the "big_cytof.R" script.  

This should produce two .pdf files, one which contains the plots shown in Figure 3 & 4 (along with several pages of other plots: "02_Osteocalcin_VDAC_mask_n_stripped.pdf") and another which contains exactly Figure 4 from the manuscript ("Fig4.pdf").
